# C# to V // TinyRPG

## Introduction

This is a simple project to demonstrate how to convert a C# project to V. It is a tiny command-line RPG game that allows the player to create a character and fight randomly generated enemies on every turn. Gameplay is limited to attacking and defending (counter-attacking), but this project demonstrates a few key features of V:

1. How to use interfaces, structs and custom functions.
2. Struct embedding and how it helps code-reuse.
3. Generating random numbers.

## Running the game

For the C# project, you just need to do this in the `csharp` folder:

```
dotnet run .
```

For the V project, the command is similar, which must be run in the `v/rpg` folder:

```
v run .
```
